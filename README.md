*Image Encryption Tool 

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
This project is a *simple image encryption and decryption tool* built in *Java*  
It supports *XOR-based encryption*, which is reversible (same process for encrypting and decrypting).  

The program reads an image file, applies a mathematical operation (XOR) to every pixel, and saves the result as a new image.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Encrypts and decrypts images using *pixel XOR operation*.  
- Works with *PNG, JPG, BMP* formats.  
- No database or internet required.  
- Lightweight and easy to run.

## ðŸ›  How It Works  
1. Reads the original image using BufferedImage.  
2. Loops through each pixel and applies:
